# OmexdiaCalibrationPackage

This script is part of the [OmexdiaCalibration suite](https://github.com/MAST-ULiege/OmexdiaCalibrationPackage) 
This toolbox is aimed at facilitating the calibration of the Omexdia diagenetic model on the basis of user data.
The package essentially relies on codes and methods developed by K. Soetaert (NIOZ).

For introduction here is a [minimal example of use](OmexCal_MinimalRun.md).

# Calibration procedure

The toolbox offers solution to calibrate the OMEXDIA diagentic model to own user data. It is step-wise and may be adapted for different type of data including profiles of dissolved nutrients (dissolved organic carbon, nitrate, ammoniumn, phosphate and silicate) and solid phases (organic carbon content, total nitrogen content, silicious detritus); fluxes at the sediment-water interface (as obtained from incubation experiments) and microprofiles (typically oxygen). 

The model, data formatting and procedures for implementation are described in the [project wiki(https://github.com/MAST-ULiege/OmexdiaCalibrationPackage/wiki)].
