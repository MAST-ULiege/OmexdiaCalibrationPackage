# OmexdiaCalibrationPackage

This script is part of the OmexdiaCalibration suite (https://github.com/MAST-ULiege/OmexdiaCalibrationPackage) 
This toolbox is aimed at facilitating the calibration of the Omexdia diagenetic model on the basis of user data.
The package essentially relies on codes and methods developed by K. Soetaert (NIOZ).

For introduction here is a [minimal example of use](OmexCal_MinimalRun.md)
